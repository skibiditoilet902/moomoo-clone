AND CAN YOU PLEASE fix it so that when you type in food it doesn't do stone anymore cause that bug is really annoying and when i type stone it does food.
also another error when i do the /shield command and then do the /kill command to that person they odn't die even tho it's supposed to bypass through and still kill them along with the /explode command also the /shield others effect me to when it's only supposed to effect others and not me also so does the /explode others it's supposed to effects others excluding me so fix that to. I also need you to transform the project so it's able to run in vercel. also the /id and /ids command is also supposed to auto update just like the /ids toggle and /id toggle command. also remove the "you have been warned" and /warn and /reports remove those also can you make it so this can run in vercel.
