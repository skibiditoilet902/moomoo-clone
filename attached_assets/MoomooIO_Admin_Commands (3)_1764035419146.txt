MooMoo.io Clone Admin Command System (Polished Version)

This document outlines a comprehensive admin command system for a MooMoo.io clone, including player permissions, command formats, login systems, and server configuration. It is designed to be clear, logical, and developer-friendly.

1. Admin Rules and Permissions
1.1 Automatic Admin Assignment

Players automatically become admin only after executing the command:

/login zahrefrida


Once logged in, the admin immediately sees their own player ID and the IDs of all other players.

Players who do not log in remain normal players; their IDs are hidden from everyone except admins.

1.2 ID Visibility

Admins can see all player IDs at all times, including their own.

Normal players cannot see IDs.

Admins: Can execute all admin commands.

Normal players: Can only execute the /report [player name] command.

Commands must not crash the game and should work without limits unless explicitly stated.

2. Command Format
