This project utilises .env files with the dotenv module for configuration. Simply make a file named .env in the root of the cloned repo, and populate it with environment variables.

A .env file is similar to a Unix shell file, and uses the same syntax for assigning environment variables.
Sample .env file:

PORT=8080
MAX_CPS=20
MODERATOR_PASSWORD=password123

Commands can be called from the terminal that Sanctuary is run from, and from chat.

While Sanctuary doesn't enforce this with chat commands, with the normal MooMoo.io client, chat has a 15 character limit. When called from chat, commands must be prefixed with a / (slash) to differentiate them from normal chat.

The player ID can be found from the API, or by the number beside the player's name.

Password Login System
Sanctuary provides an additional login system for cases where not all moderators can be fully trusted. In this scheme, a password is used. The password is set with the environment variable MODERATOR_PASSWORD.
Admins utilize the /login command to log in. A major problem with this system's current implementation is that these temporary "admins" are able to use /promote to become permanent admins, so this system is not quite ready for production.
