# MooMoo.io Clone

## Overview
This is a fully working MooMoo.io private server implementation with extensive admin commands. The project consists of:
- A webpack-powered client (frontend) with game assets and UI
- An Express + WebSocket server (backend) handling game logic and multiplayer functionality
- npm workspaces for monorepo management

## Project Structure
- `client/` - Frontend source code and static assets
- `server/` - Game server source using ES modules
- `shared/` - Shared configuration between client and server
- `dist/` - Build artifacts (auto-generated, ignored by git)

## Setup Configuration
- **Port**: 5000 (Replit requirement for frontend)
- **Host**: 0.0.0.0 (allows Replit proxy access)
- **Cache Control**: Disabled to prevent stale content in iframe
- **Build System**: Webpack for client bundling

## Commands
- `npm run build` - Build production client bundle
- `npm run build:dev` - Build client in development mode with watch

## Vercel Deployment

This project is configured for split deployment:

### Client (Vercel - Static)
1. The `vercel.json` is configured for static client hosting
2. Deploy to Vercel: `vercel --prod`
3. Build command: `npm run build`
4. Output directory: `dist/client`

### Server (Railway/Render/Fly.io - WebSocket Support)
**Important**: Vercel does NOT support persistent WebSockets. The game server must be deployed to a WebSocket-capable platform.

1. Deploy to Railway, Render, or Fly.io
2. Set environment variables:
   - `PORT=5000`
   - `MODERATOR_PASSWORD=your-admin-password`
3. After deploying, update `client/public/html/play.html`:
   ```javascript
   window.__MOOMOO_CONFIG__ = {
       WS_URL: "wss://your-server-domain.railway.app"
   };
   ```
4. Rebuild and redeploy the client

## Recent Changes (November 26, 2025)
- Added super hammer weapon with lightning effect
- Added /smite command with lightning visual and "SMITED" blue text
- Added kick/ban notifications with countdown timer
- Added 20+ new admin commands
- Fixed food/stone resource swap bug
- Fixed /shield bypass for /kill and /explode
- Fixed /shield others and /explode others affecting self
- Added client-side visual effects for lightning and explosions
- Configured for Vercel static deployment + external WebSocket server

## Architecture
- The server serves both static client files and WebSocket API
- Client connects via WebSocket for real-time multiplayer gameplay
- Express handles HTTP routes, WebSocket handles game communication
- MsgPack used for efficient binary message encoding
- Admin commands parsed and executed server-side

## User Preferences
- Game runs on port 5000 for Replit compatibility
- All hosts allowed for proxy compatibility
- Cache disabled to prevent stale content issues
